# Project Evaluation

We use the following rubric for our evaluation, but ultimately it is up to your
instructors as to whether your project is complete.

## Hard Requirements

## Criteria

We will evaluate your project according to the following criteria:

- **Code Quality:** Is the code well formatted? Is the code easy to read and
  understand? Does the code follow best practices?
- **Technical Requirements:** How does the project stack up to the requirements
  for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in
  a way that makes sense?
- **Creativity & Interface:** Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work
  well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI
  Themes?
- **Functionality:** Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it
  present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that
  makes sense?
- **Presentation:** Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well
  organized and free of clutter?

## Scoring

Each of the above categories will be scored according to the following:

| Score | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | Incomplete  |
| 1     | Progressing |
| 2     | Performing  |
| 3     | Excelling   |

For a project to be considered complete, you must achieve at least "Progressing"
in each category. However, at a minimum, you should aim to achieve "Performing"
in every category.
