# Frontend Planning

#### Planning process of Frontend for Project 3 (Survivor Fantasy League)

## Functionality
* First we needed to determine our main.jsx 
* Then we moved to the Header and Home components
* Then to our Index that handles a lot of our formatting functionality from our schema form to modul forms to  our "exile" (delete) forms to our adding contestant forms.
* Once we knew everything was working properly then we started styling more and more css with a couple moduls to try and get the look everyone was satisfied with.
