* Design elements implemented using HTML and CSS. 


## <a name="nextsteps"></a>Project Next Steps
* Allow users to create their own "dream team" of 12 contestants.
* Add a feature like challenges which would generate winners of challenges based on contestant stats. 
* Add a sign in feature so you can continue to use your own contestants that you have created to find the final three after a given amount of time.   
* Implement more pages and routes that make the user feel like they are more in control of their own card game.
* Having visual indicators when someone is merged or exiled, this way the user can see who is merged and exiled instead of trying to remember that. 
* Generate outcome button having more detailed results with metrics based on votes cast, challenge wins, etc... Just have it mirror realistic survivor seasons. 
* Adding sound to the application as a whole. Reactive sounds and "waiting" sounds.

## <a name="author"></a>About the Author
* Being our (James Fagan, Jillian Tanda, Pepper Rostamizadeh) first group project I feel like we "ham and egged" very well with proper planning steps in order to feel comfortable with what we produced as a product. Dividing responsibilities according to what each person felt confident in and fluent communication made this project flow smoothly.
